      <p>COLUMBIA - With the summer holidays coming up, a team of reporters gathered data from the Missouri State Highway Patrol that shows how many DUIs each major holiday received from 2010-2014. 2015 data is still being processed, according to MSHP officials.    <p>

      <p>Focuses are on data from the following holidays: Valentine’s Day, Mardi Gras, St. Patrick’s Day, Memorial Day, Halloween, Christmas Eve/Christmas Day, and New Year’s Eve/New Year’s Day. These are holidays that people are prone to consume more alcoholic beverages, according to the data from MSHP.<p>

      <p>In the five-year period studied, New Year’s Day holds the record of highest number of DUI holiday crashes with 200. This is followed by St. Patrick’s Day (118), Valentine’s Day (100), Halloween (99) and Christmas Eve/New Year’s Eve tied for fifth (94). <p>

      <p>Altogether, from 2010-2014, holiday DUI crashes have killed 23 people. The individual holiday which showed the most accidents caused by DUI was New Year’s Eve of 2013. The data also shows the most common holiday crash is “motor vehicle in transport,” meaning motor vehicle in traffic on a highway, driverless motor vehicle in motion, motionless motor vehicle abandoned on a roadway, disabled motor vehicle on a roadway.  <p>

      <p>The data also showed the county with the highest accident rate from DUI is St. Louis County. Worth County had the lowest number.  <p>

      <p>As for the top factor causing DUI crashes, the top two factors came out as “none” and “null.” Missouri State Highway Patrol refused to answer why this data was not collected. The third top factor was driving in the wrong track. <p>

      <p>The age range of these DUI crashes goes from 15 to 85. According to the data, 129 cases of DUI crashes involved drivers under 21. This is a cause for concern as the drivers committed two crimes at a time. First drinking while not of legal age and secondly drinking more than the legal limit. However, many young people were on the receiving end of the DUI accidents. St. Louis County is the No. 1 county where the youngest victims are most common.  <p>

      <p>The gender ratio of holiday DUI crashes, female to male, is  1: 3.25. This means that for every one woman involved in an accident due to DUI, men are more than three times likely to be involved. However, because of the 30 unknown cases, the ratio can’t be taken as the last word. <p>

      <p>Between the two biggest cities in Missouri, St. Louis and Kansas City, Kansas City had more holiday crashes between 2010-2014.  <p>

      <p>Between Boone County and Cole County, Boone for having Columbia and Cole for having Jefferson City, Boone County had more holiday crashes. </p>
